<h1>My Project is simple Dictionary</h1>

<p>My project is a simple dictionary application. This application allows users to search for words and displays the results. Its main functionality is to enable users to input a word and then view its definition, pronunciation, and other attributes. The application accesses an external API (such as DictionaryAPI) to retrieve the definition of a word and processes the responses from the API based on the user's input. When a user inputs a word, the application communicates with the API, retrieves the definition of the word, and then displays this definition to the user. Additionally, if users make incorrect inputs, the application provides appropriate feedback to inform them. For example, if a search is made without entering a word or if an invalid response is received from the API, the application displays a suitable error message to the user. With its simple interface and functionality, the application allows users to quickly and easily search for words. It can be used in everyday language use or learning processes, meeting the basic need for a dictionary</p>

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
